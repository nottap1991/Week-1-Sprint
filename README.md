# Week-1-Sprint

Proposal:

I am proposing a small text-based adventure with the goal of practicing back and front end development and functionality. For the first week sprint, the main goal is to develop a backend functionality utilising aspects from Spring and H2 Database. The basic idea would be to create a small starting town, and navigating through the area with dialog choices. The dialog choices would be performed using flow control methods within Java, and the choices would be saved within the database. A simple story outline will be written on MS word. 

The plan will be to create backend funtionality that follows ACID practices and is set up for simple integration with a front end framework. At this time, the goal is to set up methods that allow for the user to add and view "StartingTypes", allow the user to create a new player using those types, and be able to come back to a game and view what a certain player's type and level is.

The methods created should follow a simple DAO, Service, Controller practice that could easily be replicated for story methods later in development.
