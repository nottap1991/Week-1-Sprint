# Week-1-Sprint

Proposal:

I am proposing a small text-based adventure with the goal of practicing back and front end development and functionality. For the first week sprint, the main goal is to develop a backend console app utilising aspects from Spring and Oracle SQL. The basic idea would be to create a small starting town, and navigating through the area with dialog choices. The dialog choices would be performed using flow control methods within Java, and the choices would be saved within the SQL database. A simple story outline will be written on MS word. 

The second week's goal would be to attach the backend to a frontend using an Angualar framework. The goal behind this would be to create a smoother and more user friendly interface. The basic functionality and choices should not be changed in the backend, simply reworking them to be used within a browser.
